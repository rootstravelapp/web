		# Title tags should be a maximum of 70 characters long, including spaces.
		# Your most important words (keywords) need to be first in your title tag, with your least important words being last in the title tag (most to least).
		# Use pipes | to separate important (keyword) phrases (no commas, underscores, dashes or any other punctuation unless the keyword is written that way).
		# Keep your important phrases short and simple. Leave out words that would make it read like a sentence. 
		# If your company name is not part of the important (keyword) phrases, put it at the end of the title tag; if it is part of your important words, put it as the first words in the title tag. Some SEOs will tell you to leave it out. You can leave it in for branding purposes – so people will see the brand and click. This isn’t valid for all sites.
		# They must be written differently for every page. Don’t mass replicate your title tags.
		# Title tags must be written to be descriptive of the content on the page. (e.g., the About Page would be:
